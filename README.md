## Data Science? 😨

Data Science is a field that involves using advanced computational and statistical techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data. In simple terms, it's about analyzing and making sense of large amounts of information in order to understand patterns, make predictions, and inform decisions. This includes tasks such as collecting, cleaning, and organizing data, as well as applying machine learning and other analytical methods to uncover trends and relationships within the data. Data Science is used in a wide variety of industries, from finance and healthcare to marketing and entertainment, and has the potential to improve efficiency, increase profitability, and drive innovation.

## Data Science vs Data Analysis 🥵
Data Science and Data Analysis are related, but they are not exactly the same thing.

- Data Analysis is a subset of Data Science, and it involves examining data in order to draw conclusions, identify patterns, and make predictions. Data analysis may involve tasks such as data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis, but it typically focuses on specific questions or problems, rather than the broader scope of Data Science.

- Data Science, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive field that encompasses a wide range of skills and techniques, including data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and data engineering. Data Science involves not only analyzing data but also developing and applying models and algorithms to solve complex problems and generate insights. It often involves working with large and complex datasets, and it may also involve the use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and deep learning.

=> In summary, while Data Analysis is a part of Data Science, Data Science is a more comprehensive field that involves a broader set of skills and techniques beyond just data analysis.
